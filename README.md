## Getting Started

### ESP32 Setup
1. **PlatformIO** is used for ESP32 development. 
2. The ESP32 code is located in the `src/main.cpp` file.
3. To connect the ESP32 to Wi-Fi, open `src/main.cpp` and enter your **Wi-Fi SSID** and **password** in the designated fields:

   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "your_wifi_ssid";  // Enter your Wi-Fi SSID here
   const char* password = "your_wifi_password";  // Enter your Wi-Fi password here
